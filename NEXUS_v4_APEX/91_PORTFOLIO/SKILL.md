# NEXUS PORTFOLIO Engine v4.0 APEX
**Show, don't tell. The best portfolio is a product — built with the same craft you claim to have.**

## The Core Philosophy

Your portfolio IS the interview. Every spacing decision, every micro-interaction, every loading state is a live demonstration of your skill. A designer whose portfolio has bad spacing or a developer whose site is slow is already failing the test.

**Three rules above all:**
1. **Show don't tell** — "I care about details" means nothing. A pixel-perfect site with correct spacing says it louder.
2. **One unforgettable thing** — What makes you different? Answer in 8 words or less. If you can't — keep thinking.
3. **Context + Problem + Solution + Impact** — Every case study follows this structure. Never just before/after screenshots.

## PHASE 1 — Personal Brand Brief (Complete Before Building)

```
IDENTITY
Name/Handle:        [Your name or brand]
Differentiator:     [What makes you different in 8 words or less]
Tone:               [3 adjectives: e.g. "precise, bold, unconventional"]
Target role:        [What job/client are you attracting?]
Anti-pattern:       [What don't you want to signal?]

AESTHETIC DIRECTION
Style:              [Choose from: minimal / bold / editorial / dark luxury / creative]
Primary color:      [One intentional accent]
Font system:        [Display + body pair from typography.md]
Motion style:       [Subtle / cinematic / playful]

CONTENT
Projects to show:   [2–5 best. Quality over quantity always]
Skills to signal:   [Top 5 — be specific, not generic]
Story to tell:      [Career arc in 2 sentences]
Social proof:       [Testimonials, companies, metrics]
```

---

## PHASE 2 — Site Architecture

```
/                   → Hero + Selected Work + Skills Signal + CTA
/work/[slug]        → Case Study (individual project page)
/about              → Story + Skills + Experience + Values + Photo
/contact            → Simple form or booking link
```

**Navigation law:** ≤ 5 nav items. Portfolio sites with 8 links look amateur.

---

## PHASE 3 — Hero Section (Make It Unforgettable)

The hero is the peak moment. The rest of the site either confirms or fails what it promises.

```
Structure:
[Available for work] badge — accent color, pulsing dot
[Name] — display font, hero size
[Differentiator in 8 words] — bold, clear, no jargon
[2-sentence bio] — who you serve and how
[Primary CTA: "View Work"] [Secondary CTA: "Contact Me"]
[Social proof: logos / metric / "Previously at X"]
```

**Entrance animation (mandatory):**
```tsx
// Name fades up first, then differentiator, then bio, then CTAs
// Stagger: 0.1s between each element
// Duration: 600ms, expo-out easing
const heroSequence = [
  { element: 'badge', delay: 0 },
  { element: 'name', delay: 0.1 },
  { element: 'tagline', delay: 0.2 },
  { element: 'bio', delay: 0.35 },
  { element: 'ctas', delay: 0.5 },
  { element: 'social-proof', delay: 0.65 },
];
```

---

## PHASE 4 — Case Study Structure (Show Don't Tell)

Every project page follows this exact structure. Deviation requires justification.

### The 6-Part Case Study Template

```markdown
## 01 — OVERVIEW
[1-paragraph hook. The problem, why it matters, your role.]
[Key metrics if available: "Reduced checkout abandonment by 34%"]

## 02 — THE PROBLEM
[Context: who, what, when, why it was broken]
[Avoid: "the client wanted X" — focus on user/business problem]
[Include: data, pain points, constraints]

## 03 — MY PROCESS
[Show the thinking, not just the output]
[Research → Ideation → Decisions → Rationale]
[Include: sketches, wireframes, decisions you rejected and why]
[This section separates junior from senior]

## 04 — THE SOLUTION
[Design/code decisions and why they work]
[Show: before → after comparisons]
[Show: component breakdowns]
[Show: responsive behavior at multiple viewports]
[Show: interaction patterns (link to prototype or demo)]

## 05 — TECHNICAL DEPTH (for dev/fullstack)
[Stack decisions and why]
[Performance: Lighthouse scores, load times]
[Architecture decisions: why this approach over alternatives]
[Accessibility: what you specifically implemented]

## 06 — IMPACT
[Results, metrics, feedback — be specific]
["Users loved it" = worthless. "Task completion increased 28%" = powerful]
[Testimonial if available]
[What you'd do differently]
```

### Case Study Visual Requirements
```
□ Hero image: full-width project screenshot or mockup
□ Before/after: explicit comparison, not implied
□ Process artifacts: sketches, wireframes, explorations (shows thinking)
□ Final result: multiple viewport sizes shown
□ Detail shots: the micro-interactions, the edge cases, the polish
□ Prototype link: interactive demo if possible
□ No stock photos — your actual work only
```

---

## PHASE 5 — Project Grid (Selected Work)

```tsx
// Project card — minimum required information
interface ProjectCard {
  title: string;           // Project name
  category: string;        // "Product Design" | "Full-Stack" | "Brand"
  tags: string[];          // ["React", "TypeScript", "Figma"] — max 4
  thumbnail: string;       // High quality screenshot or mockup
  slug: string;            // URL to case study
  highlight?: string;      // Optional: one standout metric "34% conversion lift"
}

// Grid: 2 col on tablet, 2 col on desktop (max 3 — quality over quantity)
// Featured project: full-width or 2-col span
// Hover: image zooms slightly (scale 1.05), overlay shows role + CTA
```

**Project selection rule:** Show your best 3–5, never 10+. More projects = more chances to show mediocre work. Every project shown is a vote for the quality of your judgment.

---

## PHASE 6 — Skills Signal Section

Never just a list of technology logos. Signal expertise through evidence.

```
WRONG:
[React logo] [TypeScript logo] [Figma logo]

RIGHT:
"I build with:"
React · TypeScript · Next.js · Tailwind · Framer Motion
↕
"Proven in:"
[Project name] — specific thing you built with this skill
```

**Or quantify:**
```
React        ████████████  4 years
TypeScript   █████████     3 years
UI Design    ██████████    4 years
```

---

## PHASE 7 — About Page

```markdown
# The Story (not the resume)

[Opening hook: the moment you knew this was your path]

[What drives you: specific, genuine, not cliché]

[How you work: process, collaboration style, what you obsess over]

[Where you've been: 3–5 companies/projects, outcome-focused not duty-focused]
"At [Company], I redesigned the onboarding flow and reduced drop-off by 40%"
NOT: "At [Company], I was responsible for UX design"

[What you're looking for: be specific — remote / in-person / type of work / team size]

[Outside work: 1–2 sentences — human, not performative]
```

---

## PHASE 8 — Contact Section (Convert Interest)

```
The goal: make it effortless to reach you.

Required:
□ Email (clickable mailto: link)
□ Response expectation ("I reply within 24 hours")
□ Best for (hiring / freelance / collaboration — pick your focus)

Optional but effective:
□ Calendar link (Calendly / Cal.com) — reduces friction to zero
□ LinkedIn
□ GitHub (for devs)
□ Dribbble / Behance (for designers)

NEVER:
□ Contact form with 8 fields
□ Captcha (signals you don't trust the person reaching out)
□ "Let's connect" with no actual way to connect
```

---

## PHASE 9 — Performance (This IS Your Demo)

A slow portfolio is the most expensive irony. Your site IS your technical demo.

```
Lighthouse targets (mandatory for devs, recommended for all):
□ Performance: 95+
□ Accessibility: 100
□ Best Practices: 100
□ SEO: 90+

□ LCP < 1.5s (hero image/text)
□ CLS = 0 (no layout shift — set image dimensions always)
□ No font flash (font-display: swap)
□ WebP images with dimensions specified
□ Preload critical fonts
```

---

## PHASE 10 — Portfolio-Specific Motion (Always On)

03_MOTION is mandatory for portfolio work. This is what separates entries from memorable ones.

**Signature moments to invest in:**
1. **Hero entrance** — staggered name + tagline + CTA reveal
2. **Project cards** — hover state: image zoom + overlay slide-up + "View Case Study"
3. **Case study reveals** — each section fades up as user scrolls
4. **Page transitions** — smooth fade between pages (100ms out, 200ms in)
5. **Scroll progress** — subtle progress bar for long case studies

**Design spell for portfolio (magnetic project cards):**
```tsx
// Project cards should feel physically attracted to the cursor
// Use MagneticButton pattern from design-spells.md
// Magnetism strength: 0.2 (subtle — not distracting from the work)
```
